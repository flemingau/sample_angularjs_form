sample_angularjs_form
=====================

This sample code is written in AngularJS.  It simulates a simple form with E-mail validation.  
Upon successful submission it mocks a call to an API storing the email address and stores a cookie
on the user's computer so that another submission is not possible.

NOTE: Recommended that you use Chrome Incognito mode
